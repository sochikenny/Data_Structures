Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean representing 
whether the array is monotonic.

An array is said to be monotonic if its elements, from left to right, are 
entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing.

Non-decreasing elements aren't necessarily exclusively decreasing; they simply don't
increase. Similarly, non-decreasing elements aren't necessarily eclusively increasing;
they simply don't increase.

Note that empty arrays and arrays of one elements are monotonic. 

Sample Input --> array = [-1,-5,-10,-1100,-1100,-1101,-1102,-9001]
Sample Output --> True
