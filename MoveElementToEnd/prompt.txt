You're given an array of integers and an integer. Write a function that moves all
instances of that integer in the array to the end of the array and returns the array.

The function should perform this in place(i.e, it should mutate the input array) and 
doesn't need to maintain the order or the other integers. 

Sample input --> array = [2,1,2,2,2,3,4,2]; toMove = 2 
Sample ouput --> [1,3,4,2,2,2,2,2]
