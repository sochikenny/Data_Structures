Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and inverts it. In other words, 
the function should swap every left node in the tree for its corresponding right
node. 

Sample Input:
Tree =     1
          /  \
         2    3
        / \  / \
       4   5 6  7
      / \     
     8   9

Sample Output:
            1
          /  \
         3    2
        / \  / \
       7   6 5  4
               / \
              9   8
